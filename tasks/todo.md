## Review
- Added OpenSpec change `update-script-load-environment` with proposal, implementation checklist, and spec deltas for load-time script environment selection.
- Added a top-level YAML `environment` key to the script model/parser/editor metadata without changing YAML auto-detection semantics for metadata-only text.
- Consolidated preset loading into a shared `Form1` helper and applied script-declared environment switching across tree selection, favorites, import/duplicate, and fallback load flows.
- Missing script-declared environments now leave the current environment unchanged and emit a non-blocking status-bar message.
- Documented the new root option in `SCRIPTING.md` and added parser/autocomplete/highlighter regression coverage.
- Hardened [SSH_Helper.csproj] against repo-local generated source leakage by excluding `artifacts/**` from default compile items, preventing duplicate assembly-attribute build failures after local verification runs.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ScriptParserTests|FullyQualifiedName~ScriptAutocompleteProviderTests|FullyQualifiedName~YamlSshSyntaxHighlighterTests"` passed (152/152).
- Verification: `openspec validate update-script-load-environment --strict --no-interactive` passed.
- Added top-level YAML flag `suppress_missing_column_warning: true` to the script model/parser and exposed it through dependency analysis.
- Updated `ValidateColumnDependencies(...)` to analyze presets individually so suppressed scripts skip the dialog while unsuppressed presets in the same run still trigger it.
- Documented the new header option in `SCRIPTING.md` with an optional-column example.
- Added parser/dependency-analysis regression tests for the new flag and metadata detection behavior.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ScriptParserTests|FullyQualifiedName~ScriptDependencyAnalyzerTests"` passed (150/150). Build emitted copy warnings because `SSH_Helper.exe` was running, but tests completed successfully.
- Prompt spacing bug root cause confirmed: zsh `PROMPT_SP` redraw artifacts were being stripped per chunk, so a split `%` + spaces/CR clear sequence leaked into the live output buffer.
- Implemented `StripZshPromptSpStreaming(..., ref carry)` and applied it in `SshShellSession` so ambiguous prompt-redraw suffixes are held across chunk boundaries and flushed safely at command end.
- Added regression tests for whole-sequence cleanup, split-chunk cleanup, legitimate mid-line percent preservation, and end-of-stream flushing.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TerminalOutputProcessorTests"` passed (51/51). Build emitted copy warnings because `SSH_Helper.exe` was running, but tests completed successfully.
- Root cause confirmed: chunk-level normalization trimmed trailing spaces on unfinished chunk lines.
- Implemented `Normalize(..., preserveTrailingSpacesOnFinalLine: true)` for live chunk rendering in `SshShellSession`.
- Added regression tests in `TerminalOutputProcessorTests` for trailing-space preservation and split-chunk word join prevention.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TerminalOutputProcessorTests"` passed (47/47).
- Added persisted `BaseEnvironment` configuration state and taught environment normalization to default/fix it alongside `ActiveEnvironment`.
- Updated `EnvironmentService` so manual rebases can persist a base environment and rename/delete/import flows keep that base valid.
- Updated `Form1` preset-load behavior so `environment:` presets switch only the active environment, while presets without `environment` restore the active environment back to the base environment.
- Added a conditional toolbar indicator that shows `Base: <name>` only while the active environment differs from the base environment.
- Added focused regression coverage for base-environment persistence plus utility tests for preset-load decisions and indicator visibility.
- Hardened both project files against generated-source leakage from repo-local `bin/**`, `obj/**`, and `artifacts/**` verification outputs.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` was attempted but failed because `bin\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.exe` was locked by a running `SSH_Helper` process (PID 15128).
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify\\obj\\` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~EnvironmentServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetEnvironmentLoadPlannerTests|FullyQualifiedName~BaseEnvironmentIndicatorFormatterTests" -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-tests\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-tests\\obj\\` passed (22/22).
- Verification: `openspec validate update-script-load-environment --strict --no-interactive` passed.
- Added OpenSpec change `update-folder-base-environments` with environment-management and preset-organization deltas for folder-level base-environment overrides.
- Extended `FolderInfo`/`PresetManager` with persisted folder base-environment metadata, invalid-reference cleanup on load, and repair helpers for environment rename/delete flows.
- Added a `Folder Base Environment` preset-folder context-menu submenu with inherited fallback labeling and immediate folder summary/environment refresh behavior.
- Preset loads now resolve environment precedence as global base -> nearest folder base -> script-declared preset environment, and folder selection/execution now applies the resolved folder base before use.
- Added focused regression coverage for pure folder-base resolution and temp-config preset-manager persistence/repair flows.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests"` passed (9/9).
- Verification: `openspec validate update-folder-base-environments --strict --no-interactive` passed.
- Patched the `Folder Base Environment` context-menu entry so clicking it explicitly opens the dropdown instead of relying on implicit submenu behavior.
- Replaced the fragile nested `Folder Base Environment` submenu interaction with a direct chooser context menu launched after the parent menu closes.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed after the chooser rework.
- Confirmed the second-stage chooser `ContextMenuStrip` could be disposed while WinForms was still closing the parent context menu, causing the reported `ObjectDisposedException`.
- Replaced the folder base chooser with a modal selection dialog built on the existing `ScriptChooseDialog` path, keeping the interaction outside the context-menu disposal lifecycle.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed after the dialog-based crash fix.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests"` passed (9/9).
- Updated folder-detail base-environment text to include the inherited source folder path, so switching between folders shows which ancestor is supplying the effective base.
- Added selected-folder summary refresh on environment changes so the details pane stays synchronized while folder-driven environment switching occurs.
- Added focused formatter regression tests for folder summary and inherit-choice labels.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed with one retry warning because `SSH_Helper.dll` was in use during the copy step.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests|FullyQualifiedName~FolderBaseEnvironmentSummaryFormatterTests"` passed (14/14).
- Confirmed folder-to-folder clicks could leave the first folder summary visible because the custom TreeView click flow could miss the expected `AfterSelect`-driven refresh.
- Added a shared folder-selection handler plus click-path fallback refresh in both preset and favorites trees so folder clicks update the command pane even when WinForms selection events are inconsistent.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests|FullyQualifiedName~FolderBaseEnvironmentSummaryFormatterTests"` initially failed because `obj\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.dll` was locked by another process.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests|FullyQualifiedName~FolderBaseEnvironmentSummaryFormatterTests"` passed (14/14).
- Confirmed the real blocker was the Scintilla-based command editor staying read-only after the first folder summary, which prevented later programmatic text replacements from taking effect.
- Patched `ScintillaScriptEditorControl` so `Text` and `Clear()` temporarily disable read-only during programmatic updates and then restore the prior read-only state.
- Added focused UI regression tests covering programmatic `Text` replacement and `Clear()` while the editor remains read-only.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed with apphost copy retry warnings because `SSH_Helper.exe` was running.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ScintillaScriptEditorControlTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests|FullyQualifiedName~FolderBaseEnvironmentSummaryFormatterTests"` passed (40/40) with the same running-exe copy warnings.
- Confirmed manual environment switches could refresh folder details too early from the environment-changed event, before the new base environment was persisted, leaving the folder summary on the old global-base label.
- Refreshed selected-folder details after manual environment/base-switch completion and after environment-management flows that keep a folder summary visible.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` failed because `obj\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.dll` and `bin\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.exe` were locked by a running `SSH_Helper` process (PID 11172).
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-env-refresh\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-env-refresh\\obj\\` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ScintillaScriptEditorControlTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetBaseEnvironmentResolverTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetManagerFolderBaseEnvironmentTests|FullyQualifiedName~FolderBaseEnvironmentSummaryFormatterTests" -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-env-refresh-tests\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-env-refresh-tests\\obj\\` passed (40/40).
- Extracted preset-load environment status text into `PresetEnvironmentStatusFormatter` so restore, successful switch, and missing-environment notifications stay consistent.
- Added the missing success message for preset-declared environment switches, emitted only after `TrySwitchEnvironment(...)` succeeds.
- Added focused formatter regression tests for global-base restore, folder-base restore, successful environment switch, and missing-environment messaging.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` failed because `bin\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.exe` was locked by a running `SSH_Helper` process (PID 56684).
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-preset-switch\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-preset-switch\\obj\\` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PresetEnvironmentLoadPlannerTests|FullyQualifiedName~PresetEnvironmentStatusFormatterTests" -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-preset-switch-tests\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-preset-switch-tests\\obj\\` passed (8/8).
- Added `HostsFileIndicatorFormatter` and wired the hosts header label to show `Hosts: <file>` or `Hosts: <file> (unsaved)` with `Unsaved` fallback when no backing CSV path exists.
- Refreshed the hosts header through the shared host-count/selection paths and the remaining save, column-edit, delete-cell, and restore-state transitions that change CSV identity or dirty state without changing host counts.
- Adjusted the hosts header title label to fill available space with ellipsis so longer filenames do not crowd out the host count on the right.
- Added focused regression tests for missing-path, clean-file, and dirty-file indicator formatting.
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostsFileIndicatorFormatterTests"` failed because `bin\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\SSH_Helper.exe` was locked by a running `SSH_Helper` process (PID 59064).
- Verification: `dotnet build SSH_Helper.csproj -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-hosts-header\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-hosts-header\\obj\\` passed.
- Verification: `dotnet test SSH_Helper.Tests/SSH_Helper.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostsFileIndicatorFormatterTests" -p:BaseOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-hosts-header-tests\\bin\\ -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=artifacts\\verify-hosts-header-tests\\obj\\` passed (3/3).
