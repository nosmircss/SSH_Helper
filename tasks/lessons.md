# Lessons

- If I run verification with custom output paths inside the repo, I must either clean those generated folders or exclude them from compile globs before handing off.
- Before saying testing is complete, I must run at least one normal `dotnet build` for the touched project, not only a workaround-based test command.
- If verification required special build flags, I must say that explicitly and explain whether the normal build path also passes.
- When a user corrects UI indicator behavior, I must capture the exact visibility rule instead of assuming the indicator should always be visible.
