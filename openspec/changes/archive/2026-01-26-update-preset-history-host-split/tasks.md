## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Capture per-host execution results for preset runs and attach them to the history entry.
- [x] 1.2 Update history selection logic to show the host list for any entry with per-host results (not only folder entries).
- [x] 1.3 Persist per-host results for preset runs in saved state and restore them on load.
- [x] 1.4 Present the execution options dialog for preset runs that target multiple hosts.
- [x] 1.5 Add or update tests for history result storage, selection behavior, and multi-host preset dialog triggers.
- [x] 1.6 Manual verification: run a preset on one host and multiple hosts, confirm the dialog appears for multi-host selection, and verify per-host history display.
